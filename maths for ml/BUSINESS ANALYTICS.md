Comparing std of dataset is meaning less but comparing the coefficents of datasets has some meaning

# Three main measures of vairability
- std
- variance[[BUSINESS ANALYTICS]]
- coefficient of variation
# coefficient of variation
-  doesn't have unit of measurement
- Universal across datasets
- perfect for comparisons

# Measures of relationship between variables
- Covariance->the two variables are co related and the main statistic to measure this correlation is called <span style="color:#ffff00">covariance</span>
 - it could be positive,zero or negative
- positive-> if the variables move together in the same direction
- negative->if the variables move together in the opposite direction
- 0->if the variables are independent
- Linear correlation<span style="color:#c723c2"> coefficient</span>
